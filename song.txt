Hit the road Jack and don't you come back
No more, no more, no more, no more
Hit the road Jack and don't you come back
No more
What'd you say?
Hit the road Jack and don't you come back
No more, no more, no more, no more
Hit the road Jack and don't you come back
No more
Oh woman, oh woman, don't treat me so mean
You're the meanest old woman that I've ever have seen
I guess if you say so
I'll have to pack my things and go (that's right)
